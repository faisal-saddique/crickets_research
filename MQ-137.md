## Interfacing MQ-137 with Raspberry Pi

To use the MQ137 Ammonia Gas Sensor with a Raspberry Pi, you will need to connect the sensor to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. Here are the steps to follow:

1.	Gather the required components:
-	MQ137 Ammonia Gas Sensor
-	Raspberry Pi board (any version)
-	Jumper wires
-	Breadboard (optional)

2.	Connect the sensor to the Raspberry Pi:
-	Connect the heater pins (H pins) of the MQ137 sensor to the 5V pin and ground pin of the Raspberry Pi.
-	Connect the two A pins of the MQ137 sensor to any of the analog input pins (A0-A5) of the Raspberry Pi using jumper wires.
-	Connect the two B pins of the MQ137 sensor to a resistor, and then connect the other end of the resistor to the ground pin of the Raspberry Pi.
Note: The MQ137 sensor module is also available, which has four pins - VCC, GND, AOUT, and DOUT. You can use this module and connect VCC to 5V pin, GND to ground pin, AOUT to an analog input pin, and DOUT to a digital input pin of the Raspberry Pi.

3.	Install the required software:
-	Install the Adafruit CircuitPython library on the Raspberry Pi using the following command:

`sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-mcp3xxx`

-	Make sure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet to download and install the library.

4.	Code the Raspberry Pi:
-	Open the Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) on your Raspberry Pi.
-	Import the required libraries by adding the following lines of code at the beginning of your Python 

`import board import busio 
import adafruit_mcp3xxx.mcp3008 as MCP 
from adafruit_mcp3xxx.analog_in import AnalogIn`

-	Set up the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) connection using the following code:
makefileCopy code
spi = busio.SPI(clock=board.SCK, MISO=board.MISO, MOSI=board.MOSI) cs = MCP.P0_0 mcp = MCP.MCP3008(spi, cs) 
-	Create an AnalogIn object for the MQ137 sensor using the following code:
cssCopy code
chan = AnalogIn(mcp, MCP.P0_1) # Change P0_1 to the pin you connected the A pins of MQ137 sensor to 
-	Read the analog input from the MQ137 sensor and calculate the gas concentration using the following

`voltage = chan.voltage # Read analog voltage from the sensor resistance = (5 * chan.resistance) / (voltage - chan.voltage) # Calculate resistance of the sensor ppm = resistance / 10 # Convert resistance to parts per million (ppm)`

-	Display the gas concentration on the screen using the following code:

`print("Gas concentration: ", ppm, "ppm")` 

-	Save the code and run it on the Raspberry Pi.

Note: The preheating time of the MQ137 sensor is 24 hours, so make sure you provide the required preheating time before using the sensor to get accurate values.
These are the steps to use the MQ137 Ammonia Gas Sensor with a Raspberry Pi. You can modify the code as per your requirements to use the sensor for different applications.
